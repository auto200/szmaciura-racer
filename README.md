... or [downloading source code](https://github.com/auto200/szmaciura-racer/archive/master.zip) code as a zip archive.

# IMPORTANT

If during development you want to test application on other devices in your local network, then change "start" script in `client/package.json` accordingly:
`"start": "gatsby develop -H HOST_LOCAL_IP -p PORT",`
It defaults to my local ip.
If you don't care about other devices just change it like so:
`"start": "gatsby develop",`
Default port is 8000

Then start the app in main directory with:

```
npm run start
```

The app should now be up and running at http://localhost:8000 ðŸš€ _if not specified otherwise_
